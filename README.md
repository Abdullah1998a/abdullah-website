# Abdullah's Website is coming true

This is my humble website I hope that it can draw a smile on your face.

## Who I am

I am a beginner front-end developer, based in Damascus, and I am looking for an exciting opportunity in web development. Alongside my experience in web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I am proficient in using React.js, React Router, and Tailwind CSS to design and style responsive and attractive web pages. I also utilize Framer Motion to add vitality and dynamism to the web pages I develop.

In addition to my technical skills, I have received training in front-end development from Meta through Coursera. I hold a degree in Telecommunications Engineering from Damascus University, and I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at the Syrian Virtual University.

During my free time, I enjoy hiking in nature, reading books, and staying up-to-date with the latest technological advancements to keep abreast of developments in my field.
